3. **Add bank (by admin)**: The system allows the administrator to add new banks, including their name, code, and address.

4. **Add bank branch (by admin)**: The administrator can add new branches to existing banks, specifying the branch address and number.

5. **Add a customer (by employee)**: Employees have the ability to add new customers to the system, including their SSN, name, phone number, and address.

6. **Showing a list of loans**: The system provides a list of available loans, including industry loans, commercial loans, and personal loans.

7. **Showing a list of customers**: Users can view a list of all customers registered in the system.
